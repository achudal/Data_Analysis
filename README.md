## Overview

**Supermarket sales Analysis*:

**This project analyzes sales data from a supermarket to understand trends, customer behavior, and business performance.
 It uses Python with libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to explore key insights through visualizations and summaries.**:

**Project Goals**:  
1. Find total sales and average ratings by product line.
2. Explore sales trends by payment methods and monthly performance.
3. Calculate and visualize gross income for each branch.
3. Identify correlations between features for better understanding.
